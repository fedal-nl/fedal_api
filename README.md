# Project documentation
This is an API that will be used as a backend application. It's built using Django RestFramework with PostgreSQL as Database.
It is called the `Fedal` API. The name Fedal comes from the name of the two greatest tennis players, Federer and Nadal.

# Getting started

## Components & Settings

The application exists of several component services required for the API to run.
- Django Rest Framework
- PostgreSQL
- PGAdmin
- Redis
- Redis-commander
- Celery (Celery-beat, Flower)
- nginx (only on production)

The components are defined in the docker-compose files of dev or pro.

The default Django settings file setting is `api.settings` (set in `manage.py`, `wsgi.py`, `asgi.py`, and `celery.py`).

This can be overriden by setting the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable, for instance, if you'd like to use your own local settings file, use:

    export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=api.local_settings

> NOTE: When testing, make sure you use `api.test_settings` in order for it to work properly and to avoid calling any third party API's unnecessarily.
